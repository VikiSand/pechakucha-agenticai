## Slide 02
title: 2025: The Year of the Agent (That Wasn't)
image: slide02.JPG
notes: 2025 was declared the ==year of Agentic AI==. Sam Altman predicted autonomous digital workers would transform how we operate. But it didn't really happen.

Agents were impressive in demos — ==unreliable in production==. The problem wasn't intelligence. It was architecture.

So now the question is: Was the hype wrong — or was the system design wrong?

## Slide 03
title: Why Now? Why Agents Are Suddenly Possible
image: Screenshot 2026-02-15 113151.jpg
notes: Several things matured at once. Models improved in ==reasoning and tool use==. Cloud infrastructure became cheaper and persistent. APIs became standardized.

We moved from prompt engineering → workflows → tool use → orchestration.

The shift wasn't just smarter AI. It was the ==ecosystem becoming executable==. And as AI fluency grows over time, humans and organizations can now reliably build and manage complex agent interactions.

## Slide 04
title: The Paradigm Shift
image: slide04.JPG
notes: Legacy AI answered questions. ==Agentic AI completes objectives==.

We move from: "How do I do this?" To: "Get this done for me."

This is delegation. From conversation → to execution. From assistance → to ==digital labor==.

## Slide 05
title: Platforms: Persistent Agent Stacks
image: slide05.JPG
notes: Frameworks like ==OpenClaw== made agents persistent. They don't disappear after chat. They maintain memory. They coordinate roles.

The idea isn't one chatbot. It's a ==digital team==.

This transforms AI from tool into infrastructure.

## Slide 06
title: The AI Adoption Gap
image: slide08.JPG
notes: Some organizations are building agent stacks. Others still use AI like Google. This creates an ==adoption gap==.

Productivity diverges. Capability diverges.

The real risk isn't overinvesting. It's underestimating the shift. We don't want to be on the passive side of that gap.

## Slide 07
title: Automation vs Workflow vs Agent
image: slide09 (3).JPG
notes: ==Automation is deterministic==. If X → do Y.

AI workflows embed LLMs into structured pipelines. Flexible, but still controlled.

==Agents are goal-driven systems==. They plan, decide, and act autonomously. But autonomy reduces reliability.

So the real design question is: Where do we allow flexibility — and where do we enforce control?

## Slide 08
title: What Is Agentic AI?
image: Slide10.JPG
notes: Agentic AI has three core elements: ==Autonomy. Goal orientation. Agency within an environment.==

## Slide 09
title: What Is Agentic AI?
image: Slide11.JPG
notes: It reasons step-by-step. It stores memory. It uses tools.

An agent doesn't just generate text. It interacts with systems and produces outcomes.

## Slide 10
title: What Can Agents Do?
image: Slide12.JPG
notes: Agents can:
- Conduct deep research
- Summarize project tools
- Generate schedules
- Explore codebases
- Publish content

These are not chat tasks. They are ==coordination tasks==. That's why multi-agent systems emerge.

## Slide 11
title: Agents as Teams
image: Slide19.JPG
notes: The real power isn't one super-agent. It's ==structured specialization==.

Research agent. Analysis agent. Simulation agent. Coordinator agent.

Each has constraints and responsibilities. This becomes organizational design — not prompting.

## Slide 12
title: Why This Matters for Urban Planning
image: Slide15.JPG
notes: Urban planning is complex. Regulations. Stakeholders. Data layers. Long timelines.

This is a ==coordination problem==.

Agents can aggregate zoning data, simulate scenarios, analyze compliance, synthesize reports. But not as one super-agent. As a structured human–agent team.

## Slide 13
title: From Smart City Automation to Agentic Urban AI
image: Slide14.JPG
notes: Three recent papers argue that cities are shifting from ==smart automation to Agentic Urban AI==.

**Automation** follows rules. **Autonomy** optimizes human goals. **Agency** sets and adapts its own goals.

Instead of just improving traffic flow, an agentic system might prioritize resilience or sustainability based on environmental feedback.

Cities become ==cognitive ecosystems==. AI moves from copilot to governance participant. But this requires strong, democratic oversight.

## Slide 14
title: Agentic Urban AI in Practice
image: Slide16.JPG
notes: At the ==City Science Lab in Taipei==, researchers are building agentic systems that simulate cities, analyze spatial data, and automate planning tasks.

Not dashboards. Not static models. But AI agents that reason, collaborate, and test urban futures.

This is what Agentic Urban AI looks like in practice.

## Slide 15
title: Urban Mobility Simulator
image: Slide17.JPG
notes: The ==Urban Mobility Simulator== creates a digital twin of a city. It populates it with thousands of simulated citizens — each generated by an LLM using census data.

Age, income, profession, daily habits. Each agent receives a backstory and full-day itinerary.

When 10,000 agents move simultaneously, their trips aggregate into heat maps. Planners can test policy scenarios — zoning changes, bus routes, density shifts — in a ==safe sandbox== before implementing them.

## Slide 16
title: City AI (CDAI)
video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUGfJmLnn4A

notes: ==City AI automates complex urban analytics==. Instead of manually buffering maps or intersecting GIS layers, planners ask a question in natural language.

Behind the scenes, specialized agents collaborate: A **Project Manager** breaks down the task. A **Data Agent** retrieves datasets. A **Visualization Agent** presents results.

Future versions even introduce "curiosity" — agents that explore anomalies and report insights proactively. Urban intelligence becomes accessible — not just technical.

## Slide 17
title: Roles of Agentic AI in Urban Planning
image: 0e5ee7ce-74ab-48fc-b488-5ce445901546.png
notes: Agentic AI in urban planning acts like a ==digital planning team==.

Key roles include:
- **Data Gathering & Analysis** - Synthesizes traffic, demographic, environmental data
- **Simulation & Scenario Modeling** - Tests policies before implementation
- **Task Execution & Coordination** - Automates reports, GIS updates, permits
- **Strategic Decision Support** - Supports systems thinking
- **Persistent Knowledge & Memory** - Remembers past decisions and project history
- **Participation & Mediation** - Facilitates citizen engagement

It augments planners — helping humans focus on high-level strategy.

## Slide 18
title: From Doer to Orchestrator
image: 
notes: Agentic AI changes our role. We move from ==active executors to supervisors of digital labor==.

Instead of drawing every map, running every simulation, writing every report — we design systems that do it for us.

Work shifts from execution to orchestration. From producing outputs to defining objectives.

The value no longer lies in doing the task — but in ==deciding what should be done== and verifying the outcome.

## Slide 19
title: Agent Manager & Enterprise Operator
image: Picture2.jpg
notes: In the Code AGI era, two roles emerge:

**The Agent Manager** orchestrates digital workers. They coordinate agents, manage handoffs, supervise async processes, and ensure reliability.

## Slide 20
title: Agent Manager & Enterprise Operator
image: Picture3.jpg
notes:

**The Enterprise Operator** defines strategy. They decide which problems are worth solving and align AI systems with organizational goals.

Execution becomes cheap. ==Judgment becomes scarce==. The key skills shift toward systems thinking, domain expertise, critical evaluation, and workflow redesign.

This is the new professional leverage.

## Slide 21
title: Risks: Autonomy Comes at a Cost
image: 13018e60-aa47-48c5-baaf-051ae59bd015.png
notes: Agentic systems are powerful — but ==less predictable==.

They are probabilistic. Errors compound across agents. Outputs can drift from human intent.

Security becomes critical. Persistent agents require API access, file access, 24/7 permissions.

There's also the energy question. Large-scale simulations and always-on agents consume significant compute.

Autonomy increases capability — but also ==amplifies risk==. So architecture and guardrails become essential.

## Slide 22
title: Governance: Who Is Responsible?
image: ChatGPT Image Feb 15, 2026, 06_43_56 PM.png
notes: When AI moves from tool to actor, governance must evolve.

Who sets the goals? Who audits decisions? Who is accountable for unintended outcomes?

Agentic Urban AI requires ==participatory oversight==, clear human-in-the-loop structures, and transparent evaluation.

The future is not AI replacing planners. It's ==hybrid governance== — where humans remain strategically responsible.
