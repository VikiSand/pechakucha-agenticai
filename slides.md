## Slide 02
title: 2025: The Year of the Agent (That Wasn’t)
image: ChatGPT Image Feb 15, 2026, 06_43_56 PM.png
notes: 2025 was declared the year of Agentic AI.  
Sam Altman predicted autonomous digital workers would transform how we operate.

But it didn’t really happen.  
Agents were impressive in demos — unreliable in production.

The problem wasn’t intelligence.  
It was architecture.

So now the question is:  
Was the hype wrong — or was the system design wrong?

## Slide 03
title: why now?
image: slide03.jpg
notes: Why now? Three key factors:
- Computing power has reached critical thresholds
- ==Training data== quality and quantity have improved exponentially
- Regulatory frameworks are beginning to emerge

The convergence of these factors creates a unique opportunity.

## Slide 04
title: The SHIFT
image: slide04.jpg
notes: We're witnessing a fundamental ==paradigm shift== from reactive to proactive AI systems.

Traditional AI responds to queries. ==Agentic AI== takes initiative, plans ahead, and executes complex multi-step workflows.

## Slide 05
title: Agent platforms
image: slide05.jpg
notes: The agent platform ecosystem includes:
- AutoGPT and BabyAGI for general purpose tasks
- LangChain for building custom workflows
- Specialized platforms for ==domain-specific applications==

Each platform offers different tradeoffs between flexibility and ease of use.

## Slide 06
title: OpenClaw
image: slide06.jpg
notes: OpenClaw represents our ==in-house development== of an agent framework specifically designed for research applications.

Key features include reproducibility, transparency, and integration with existing research tools.

## Slide 07
title: Adoption Gap
image: slide07.jpg
notes: There's a significant ==adoption gap== between available technology and actual implementation in research settings.

Barriers include: technical complexity, lack of training, and institutional resistance to change.

## Slide 08
title: What is it?
image: slide08.jpg
notes: What exactly is an AI agent? Think of it as a ==goal-oriented system== that can:
- Perceive its environment
- Make autonomous decisions
- Take actions to achieve objectives

## Slide 09
title: What is it?
image: slide09.jpg
notes: Agents differ from traditional software in their ability to handle ==ambiguous situations== and adapt their strategies based on feedback.

They don't just follow pre-programmed rules - they learn and evolve.

## Slide 10
title: What is it?
image: slide10.jpg
notes: The architecture typically includes:
- Perception modules for gathering information
- ==Reasoning engines== for decision-making
- Action mechanisms for executing tasks
- Memory systems for learning

## Slide 11
title: What is it?
image: slide11.jpg
notes: Modern agents leverage ==large language models== as their cognitive core, combined with specialized tools for specific tasks.

This hybrid approach provides both flexibility and reliability.

## Slide 12
title: Use Cases
image: slide12.jpg
notes: Use cases in research include:
- Literature review and synthesis
- ==Experimental design== and optimization
- Data analysis and visualization
- Report generation and documentation

## Slide 13
title: Agentic AI & Urban Planning
image: slide13.jpg
notes: In urban planning, agents can analyze ==demographic data==, traffic patterns, and environmental factors simultaneously.

This holistic approach reveals insights that traditional methods might miss.

## Slide 14
title: Agentic AI & Urban Planning
image: slide14.jpg
notes: They can simulate different ==development scenarios== and predict their long-term impacts on communities.

This enables evidence-based policy making with unprecedented detail.

## Slide 15
title: Agentic AI & Urban Planning
image: slide15.jpg
notes: Integration with ==GIS systems== allows agents to work with spatial data and create visual representations of planning alternatives.

The combination of AI reasoning and geographic context is particularly powerful.

## Slide 16
title: Agentic AI & Urban Planning
image: slide16.jpg
notes: Agents can engage with ==stakeholder feedback== by analyzing community input and identifying common themes and concerns.

This makes the planning process more participatory and responsive.

## Slide 17
title: Agentic AI & Urban Planning
image: slide17.jpg
notes: Real-time monitoring of urban systems enables ==dynamic adjustments== to plans as conditions change.

The city becomes a living laboratory for continuous improvement.

## Slide 18
title: Multi-Agents
image: slide18.jpg
notes: ==Multi-agent systems== allow specialization where different agents handle different aspects of a problem.

One agent might focus on traffic, another on environmental impact, while a coordinator synthesizes their findings.

## Slide 19
title: Key Skills
image: slide19.jpg
notes: Key skills for working with AI agents:
- ==Prompt engineering== and effective communication
- Understanding system limitations and failure modes
- Ethical considerations and bias awareness
- Integration with existing workflows

## Slide 20
title: Thank You
image: slide20.jpg
notes: Thank you! The future of research lies in ==human-AI collaboration==.

Questions and discussion welcome.
